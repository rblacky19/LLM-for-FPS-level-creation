“Design an FPS level blockout using simple geometry. Include one main route and at least two alternate paths. Place a central combat space with long-range sightlines. Make the alternate paths favor close-range combat. Use a medium density of cover throughout the level. Add two bomb sites: one located near the top-left area of the map, and a second positioned closer to the CT spawn but shifted toward the center.”
